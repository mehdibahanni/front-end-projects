                    Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages with different purposes and syntax. Java is a general-purpose language used for standalone applications, server-side development, and mobile apps. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language primarily used for web development. Java is statically typed and runs on the Java Virtual Machine, while JavaScript is dynamically typed and runs in web browsers. Despite their similar names, Java and JavaScript are unrelated in terms of syntax and purpose.

                    Yes, you can learn JavaScript without needing to learn Java. JavaScript is a distinct language used for web development, while Java is a general-purpose language. JavaScript is for web development, while Java is often used for standalone applications. Learning JavaScript does not require prior knowledge of Java. You can start learning JavaScript directly through online tutorials and practice.

                    JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development, while ECMAScript is a standard that defines the syntax and semantics of the language. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard with added features. JavaScript is widely used in web browsers and server-side environments, while ECMAScript is maintained by Ecma International. Overall, JavaScript and ECMAScript are closely related but not exactly the same.
